Note : this application is written in Windows 10.
Technologies used : Python Flask,SQLAlchemy,Docker,Mysql database.
Docker version : 20.10.10

        
To run this application inside docker containers do followings :

1.download following image that has source code of project
docker pull taylancelikjuventusdockerid/myapp2

2.then download following image that is just mysql program to be run in docker. 
docker pull taylancelikjuventusdockerid/mysql

Then follow steps given below  :

//////////////////////Prepare MYSQL program inside docker////////////////////////////////

Note : You need to download project files and store in a specific folder.Then get command prompt  of that folder.
In following lines to make it simple I wrote "c:\>" but the real directory is
your project folder's directory like c:\...\myprojectfolder\> 


step 1: this will download and run mysql program inside docker
c:\>docker run --name mysql_myapp2 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d taylancelikjuventusdockerid/mysql

step 2:copy xxx.sql file from project folder to docker container named "mysql_myapp2".
c:\>docker cp xxx.sql mysql_myapp2:/xxx.sql

step 3:get bash of container "mysql_myapp2".
c:\>docker exec -it mysql_myapp2 bash

step 4:access/run mysql program inside mysql_myapp2 container(not "-p password" but "-ppassword")
c:\>mysql -u root -ppassword

step 5:check available databases
mysql>show databases;

step 6: create new database named "xxx" .
mysql>create database xxx;

step 7: use database "xxx"
mysql>use xxx;

step 8: This is the most important step!We import database from "xxx.sql" to "xxx" named database
        which is newly created at step 7 and it has no tables.
mysql>source xxx.sql

step 9 : check if table student is imported properly
mysql> use xxx;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> select * from student;

Now you should be able to see 14 rows of table "student" are listed on console. 

step 10: Type "exit" and hit Enter till you get back to project folder in command line.

step 11: We are done with mysql inside docker.Make sure mysql_myapp2 is still running 
c:\>docker images  

step 12: run "taylancelikjuventusdockerid\myapp2" image
c:\>docker run -p 5000:5000 -d taylancelikjuventusdockerid/myapp2

step 13 : Check once again the all running  containers
c:\>docker ps

After this command you should see  both containers should be running.The  output should look like below:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS          PORTS                               NAMES
c17d17ddcec6   taylancelikjuventusdockerid/myapp2   "python app.py"          57 minutes ago      Up 13 seconds   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp              zen_brahmagupta
3c2487c6c647   taylancelikjuventusdockerid/mysql    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About an hour ago   Up 20 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql_myapp2

step 14: Finally open your web browser and type following and hit enter

http://localhost:5000 

you should be able to see students are listed .Then write following url and hit enter

http://localhost:5000/test

this url prints "test is OK"  text.


This program just demonstrates how to dockerize any program driven by SQL database.
This is why I supported only 2 endpoints in "app.py" program. 
Thanks for reading.
